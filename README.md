âš¡ Fun fact: I always have multiple iterations of personal web site. Current one is based of WordPress, previous one was static site.  
âš¡ Fun fact #2: Favorite food is something that #Bosnians can agree that is perfect: chevaps with garlic.  
âš¡ Fun fact #3: If you need somebody who can do multiple things at once, well, you found me ðŸ˜†. My workplace is messy as I always do more then one thing at once. Seriously ðŸ¤ª
